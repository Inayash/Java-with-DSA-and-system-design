Ques1:What are the conditional operators in java?
answer:In Java,conditional operators are used to evaluate expressions and make decisions based on certain conditions.
The most notable is the ternary operator ? :, which is a shorthand for simple if-else logic.
Its syntax is:condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
This operator evaluates the condition;if true,it returns the first value; otherwise, it returns the second.
Java also uses logical operators in conditional expressions: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), and ! (logical NOT).
These are commonly used in control flow statements like if, while, and for to determine program execution paths.

Ques2:What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
answer:Operators in Java (and most programming languages) can be classified based on the number of operands they work with:
1. Unary Operators
Examples: +, -, ++, --, !
2. Binary Operators
Examples: +, -, *, /, %, ==, !=, &&, ||, etc.
3. Ternary Operator
Example:
int min = (a < b) ? a : b;

Ques3:What is the use of Switch case in java programming?
answer:The switch case in Java is used to execute one block of code among multiple options based on the value of an expression. 
It provides a cleaner and more readable alternative to long chains of if-else statements, especially when comparing a single variable to many constant values.
Use of switch case:
(i)Simplifies decision-making.
(ii)Improves code readability.
(iii)Executes specific code blocks based on matching case values.
(iv)Ends execution with break to avoid fall-through.
Example:
int day = 3;
switch (day) {
  case 1: System.out.println("Monday");
  break;
  case 2: System.out.println("Tuesday");
  break;
  case 3: System.out.println("Wednesday");
  break;
  default: System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
This prints: Wednesday

Ques4:What are the priority levels of arithmetic operation in java?
answer:In Java, arithmetic operations have specific priority (precedence) levels, which determine the order in which expressions are evaluated when no parentheses are used.
Unary Operators:+, - (unary plus and minus), ++, --
Multiplicative Operators: *, /, %
Additive Operators: +, -

Ques5:What are the conditional statements and use of conditional statements in java?
answer:Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your code based on boolean expressions.
They control the flow of execution by determining which block of code should run under specific conditions.
Types of Conditional Statements:
if Statement:Executes code if a condition is true.
if (a > b) {
    System.out.println("a is greater");
}

if-else Statement:Provides an alternative block if the condition is false.
if (a > b) {
    System.out.println("a is greater");
} else {
    System.out.println("b is greater");
}
if-else if-else Ladder:Checks multiple conditions in sequence.
if (a > b) {
    // ...
} else if (a == b) {
    // ...
} else {
    // ...
}
switch Statement:Selects code to run based on the value of a variable.
switch (day) {
    case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break;
    // ...
    default: System.out.println("Invalid day");
}

Use of Conditional Statements:
(i)To make decisions during runtime.
(ii)To execute different code blocks based on specific conditions.
(iii)To control program logic (e.g., user input validation, menu-driven programs, game logic).

Ques6:What is the syntax of if else statement?
answer:syntax of if-else Statement in Java:
if (condition) {
    // Block of code if condition is true
} else {
    // Block of code if condition is false
}

Ques7:What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
answer:In Java, the three types of iterative statements (loops) are used to repeat a block of code multiple times based on a condition.
for Loop:Used when the number of iterations is known.
Syntax:
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}

while Loop:Used when the number of iterations is not known; runs as long as the condition is true.
Syntax:
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}

do-while Loop:Similar to while, but the loop body runs at least once before checking the condition.
Syntax:
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);

Ques8:Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop.
answer:Hereâ€™s a clear comparison of the for loop and do-while loop in Java:
Feature	                for Loop	                                              do-while Loop
Execution Condition     Checks the condition before the loop body runs	        Checks the condition after the loop body runs
Minimum Execution	      May not run at all if the condition is false	          Runs at least once regardless of the condition
Syntax	                for (init; condition; update) { ... }	                  do { ... } while (condition);
Use Case	              When the number of iterations is known	                When the loop must run at least once
Example	                for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)	                            do { ... } while (i < 5);

Ques9:Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
answer: Java program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop:
public class PrintNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
