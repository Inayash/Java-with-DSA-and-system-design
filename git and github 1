solution 1:Git is a free and open-source version control system used to track changes in files, coordinate work among multiple people, and manage code for software development. It helps developers collaborate, maintain a history of changes, and revert to earlier versions if needed.
solution 2:A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that keeps track of changes made to files, especially in coding projects. It lets you:
Save versions of your work.
Go back to an earlier version if needed.
Work with others on the same project without messing up each otherâ€™s changes.
It's like a "save and undo" system for files and teamwork.
solution3:GitHub is a platform for hosting and sharing code online. It works with Git to help developers store their projects, collaborate with others, and manage changes in code. Think of it as a social network for programmers to share and improve their work together.
solution 4:Some popular Git hosting services are:
GitHub
GitLab
Bitbucket
SourceForge
Azure DevOps
solution 5:The main types of Version Control Systems are:
Local VCS: Tracks changes on a single computer.
Centralized VCS (CVCS): Uses a central server to store versions (e.g., SVN).
Distributed VCS (DVCS): Each user has a full copy of the project history (e.g., Git).
solution 6:The benefits of using Git are:
Tracks Changes: Keeps a history of all file changes.
Collaboration: Allows multiple people to work on the same project.
Branching and Merging: Work on different features separately and combine them easily.
Backup: Distributed system ensures every contributor has a full project copy.
Reverts: Go back to previous versions if needed.
Speed: Fast performance for managing large projects.
solution 7:A Git repository is a storage space where Git tracks and manages all files, changes, and history of a project. It can be **local** (on your computer) or **remote** (on platforms like GitHub).
solution 8:To initialize a repository in Git:
Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder.
Run the command: git init
This creates a new Git repository in your project directory.
