ques1:What is statically typed and Dynamically typed Programming Language?
answer:In statically typed languages:
Variable types are declared explicitly and checked at compile-time.
Once a variable is declared with a type, it cannot hold values of another type unless explicitly cast.
Type-related errors are caught before the program runs.
Examples:
int number = 5;      // Valid
number = "hello";    // ❌ Compile-time error (type mismatch)
Common statically typed languages:Java,C,C++

In dynamically typed languages:
Variable types are determined at runtime, not declared in advance.
The same variable can hold values of different types at different times.
Type errors are caught during execution, not compilation.
Examples:
x = 5          # x is an integer
x = "hello"    # Now x is a string
Common dynamically typed languages:Python,JavaScript

ques2:What is the variable in Java?
answer:a variable is a named container used to store data that can be changed during the execution of a program.
Each variable in Java has a data type,which determines the kind of value it can hold,such as int for integers, double for decimals, or String for text.
Variables must be declared before they are used, and their type cannot change after declaration.
Example:
int age = 25;         // age is a variable of type int

ques3:How To Assign a Value To Variable?
answer:to assign a value to a variable, declare the variable type, write the variable name, then use = followed by the value. End with a semicolon.
Example:
int age = 25;
String name = "Alice";

ques4:What are Primitive Data types in Java?
answer:Primitive data types in Java are the most basic data types that store simple values directly.They are predefined by the language and are not objects.
Java has 8 primitive data types:
byte — 8-bit integer (-128 to 127)
short — 16-bit integer (-32,768 to 32,767)
int — 32-bit integer (-2^31 to 2^31-1)
long — 64-bit integer (-2^63 to 2^63-1)
float — 32-bit floating-point number (decimal)
double — 64-bit floating-point number (decimal)
char — 16-bit Unicode character
boolean — represents true or false
These types are efficient and hold simple values, unlike objects that store references.

ques5:What are the Identifiers in Java?
Identifiers in Java are names used to identify variables, methods, classes, and other elements.
They must start with a letter (A-Z or a-z), an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($), but cannot start with a digit.
Identifiers can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
They are case-sensitive and cannot be Java reserved keywords like int or class.
Examples of valid identifiers include myVar, _count, and $value.
Invalid examples are 123abc or class.

ques6:List the Operators in Java?
answer:operators in java
1.Arithmetic Operators
2.Relational Operators
3.Logical Operators
4.Assignment Operators
5.Unary Operators
6.Bitwise Operators

ques7:Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give an examples?
answer:Increment and Decrement operators in Java are unary operators used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1.
Types:Increment (++): Adds 1 to the variable.
Decrement (--): Subtracts 1 from the variable.
Forms:
Prefix (++var or --var): The value is changed before it’s used in the expression.
Postfix (var++ or var--): The value is changed after it’s used in the expression.
Examples:
int x = 5;
int y = ++x;  // Prefix increment: x becomes 6, then y = 6
int a = 5;
int b = a++;  // Postfix increment: b = 5, then a becomes 6
int m = 10;
int n = --m;  // Prefix decrement: m becomes 9, then n = 9
int p = 10;
int q = p--;  // Postfix decrement: q = 10, then p becomes 9
