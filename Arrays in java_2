ques1:What is the default value of Array for different data types?
answer:In Java, when you create an array without initializing its elements,the default values are automatically assigned based on the data type of the array.
Here's a table of the default values for different data types in Java arrays:
| Data Type      | Default Value             |
| ---------------| --------------------------|
| byte           | 0                         |
| short          | 0                         |
| int            | 0                         |
| lon`           | 0L                        |
| float          | 0.0f                      |
| double         | 0.0d                      |
| char           | \u0000 (null character)   |
| boolean        | false                     |
| Object types   | null                      |

ques2:Can you pass the negative number in Array size?
answer:No, you cannot pass a negative number as the size of an array in Java.
If you try to do so,the Java program will compile,but it will throw a NegativeArraySizeException at runtime.

ques3:Where does Array stored in JVM memory?
answer:In Java, arrays are stored in the heap memory of the JVM.
Heap Memory:
All objects in Java are stored in the heap,and arrays are treated as objects,regardless of their type (primitive or reference).
This includes arrays like int[], double[], String[], etc.
Even a char[] or int[] is considered an object and stored in the heap.

ques4:What are the disadvantages of Array?
answer:(i)Once we create the size cannot be increased/decreased.
(ii)It stores only homogeneous data elememts.

ques5:What is an Anonymous Array in Java ? Give an example?
answer:(i)An Array without a name is called Anonymous Array.
(ii)This type of array is created just for instance use.
example:
class Calc
{
 	public int add(int nums[])
	{
		int result=0;
		for(int n:nums)
		{
			result=result+n;
		}
		return result;
	}
}
public class anonymousArray{
	public static void main(String[] args){

	Calc obj= new Calc();
	int nums[]={5,2,3,7,8,2};
	int result=obj.add(nums);
	System.out.println(result);
	}
}

ques6:What are the different ways to traverse an Array in java?
answer:In Java, there are several ways to traverse (iterate through) an array
1. Using a for loop (classic way):
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40};
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(arr[i]);
}

2. Using an enhanced for-each loop:
for (int num : arr) {
    System.out.println(num);
}

3. Using a while loop:
int i = 0;
while (i < arr.length) {
    System.out.println(arr[i]);
    i++;
}

ques7:What is the difference between length and length() method Give an Examples?
answer:differnece between length and length():
length:It is the property of the Array type class.
//for 1-D Array
public class lengthArray{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	int nums[]={4,7,2,6};
	System.out.println(nums.length);
	}
}
output:4
//for 2-D Array
public class lengthArray{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	int nums[][]={
				{3,9,7,5},
				{1,5,6,5},
				{8,4,5,6}
				};
	System.out.println(nums[0].length);
	}
}
output:4
length():It is method of string class.
public class lengthString{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	String name= "Inaya";
	System.out.println(name.length());
	}
}
output:5
